%peer review
\section{Peer Review}
Provide a review for each individual team member's performance during this sprint, including yourself. This assessment should be your own candid opinion, and your response will not be shared with other team members. Each item should be assigned a numeric grade of 1-5, where 1 is the lowest possible score and 5 is the highest. \\

Evaluation items:
\begin{itemize}
\begin{item}
Participation - Was the team member present during meetings, work sessions, or any other planned team activities? Did they actively contribute to the development of the project?
\end{item}
\begin{item}
Communication - Did the team member provide timely updates on progress or challenges faced? Did they use any official team communication technologies effectively?
\end{item}
\begin{item}
Work quality - Was the team member willing to claim tasks from the backlog? Did the work reported by the team member provide added value to the project? If bugs were present or features were skipped, how severe was the negative impact?
\end{item}
\begin{item}
Professionalism - Did the team member conduct themselves in a way that would generally be acceptable in a professional work environment while participating in team activities? Were they respectful of their teammates? Are they taking the project seriously?
\end{item}
\begin{item}
Overall - How valuable overall was this team member to the project during this evaluation period? You may consider factors not covered in other evaluation items. A score of 1 means that, in your opinion, this individual deserves to be fired.
\end{item}
\end{itemize}
