# SD Drone 1.0 Bill of Materials (BoM)

The following BoM contains all of the parts necessary to construct a fully functional SD Drone base in a quadcopter configuration. A hexcopter configuration can also be implemented with minimal changes to the BoM (notes included below).

## Airframe components

#### Quadcopter configuration
[S500 Quadcopter frame](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0AX1MZ?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_3EBSD9N5RH0X0F3YQ54M) (QTY 1)
#### Hexcopter configuration
[S550 Hexcopter frame](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082V45KHH?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_GGC20Z02PHV8CAQTB7GC) (QTY 1)
## Power components
#### Quadcopter configuration
[5200mAh 11.1v LiPo battery](https://a.co/d/6rPRNIA) (QTY 1)

[XT60 battery connectors](https://a.co/d/amNlAyu) (QTY 1)

[Deans battery connectors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PY5HRB5?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_42JSB0MYEBG7VT80R2FB) (QTY 1)

[Deans female to XT60 male adapter](https://a.co/d/5JDpXND) (QTY 1)

*Note: The S500 frame supports multiple wiring options through an integrated power distribution board (i.e., the power distribution is built into the structural plates of the frame). This BoM is designed to support future expansion such as camera gimbals, companion computers, and other accessories. The exact set of connectors can be modified to meet your exact implementation.
#### Hexcopter configuration
[5200mAh 11.1v LiPo battery](https://a.co/d/6rPRNIA) (QTY 1)

[XT60 battery pigtails](https://a.co/d/hiIDTVV) (QTY 1)

*Note: The S550 frame includes an integrated power distribution board, but with less connector options than the S500. Powered accessories will likely require additional adapters depending on your configuration. Also, the additional lifting power could support a larger battery pack if desired.

## Flight controller, RTK GPS, Telemetry radio components

## Motors, ESCs, Propellers

#### Quadcopter configuration
[2212 920KV Brushless Motors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075DD16LK?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_5F3DHQV6FFX43MVR2MWD) (QTY 1)

[2-4S 40A Brushless ESC](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G5S9YYG?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_60P1MTQ4X0JFFXFEZADM) (QTY 1)

[Servo extension wires](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N77RTP7?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_YJKR8H5K1PNJS36T21A5) (QTY 1)

[1045 propeller pack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0823NNTKD?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) (QTY 1)

*Note: The brushless ESCs and Motors occasionally arrive DoA. They tend to be reliable in the long-term, but after many drone builds with this motor & ESC combo, maybe 10% of them are faulty on arrival. For this reason, it is recommended to buy a spare pack of motors and ESCs.

#### Hexcopter configuration
[2212 920KV Brushless Motors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075DD16LK?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_5F3DHQV6FFX43MVR2MWD) (QTY 2)

[1045 propeller pack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0823NNTKD?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) (QTY 1)

*Note: The hexcopter configuration requires 6 motors and ESCs, which are sold in 4 packs. Purchasing two packs will give you two extra motors & ESC pairs, which should address the DoA note above.
